# wunschliste-backend

I scaffolded this project with the Loopback CLI. I still struggle to implement the unique constraint for a users email (loopback issue). The solution from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55993621/how-to-make-a-model-in-loopback-4-to-have-unique-values-in-its-schema) does not seem to work.

Additionally, it seems that loopback migrations do not create sequences in postgres for the id columns.
